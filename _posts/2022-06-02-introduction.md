# GSoC_2022_Work  
  
Hey Everyone, I'm Beleswar Prasad Padhi. I'm happy to share that I will be working as a GSoC Contributor for **Metasploit** Organization this Summer. My project proposes to implement the **HTTP-Trace** feature for the Login Scanner modules of the Metasploit framework. When enabled, the HTTP-Trace option tracks every web request made to the server by the module and its respective response. This provides the user with more verbose details, which helps them in better analyzing any errors that may occur when running the module. Here is the link to my projectin the GSoC site : [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/I4PxrljP) 
  
This blog is meant to track my work for implementing the project. This will include my To-Dos, plans, bugs fixed and encountered, PRs created and documentation alongside the code for the project.  
  
### Plan:  
  
Currently, my plan is to understand the project-related library code in depth. This can be achieved by working on bugs/suggestion features streamlining to the **HTTP-Trace** feature, or reporting new ones which I encounter.  
  
### To-Do:  
  
* Work on bugs to understand codebase better.  
* Add 3 initial posts in Blog:  
    1. Experience and work done for getting selected as a GSoC contributor.  
    2. Selected Proposal and tips.  
    3. Work done in the codebase now.  
* Structure markdown files in a modular fashion (i.e, seperate files for plan, work done, To-Do etc.)
