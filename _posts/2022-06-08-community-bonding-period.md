This article summarizes the work done during the Community Bonding Period of Google Summer of Code. It also enlsits some important changes made in the Plan of work for implementing the Project in the coding period.  
  
As mentioned in the last blog post [read it here](https://3v3ryone.github.io/gsoc/2022-06-02-introduction/), our target for GSoC is to implement the **HTTP-Trace** feature for Login Scanner Modules. Let's continue and look at the work done during the Community Bonding Period. Here is the link to my project in the GSoC site : [Project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/I4PxrljP)  
  
## What is the Community Bonding Period? 
The Community Bonding Period is dedicated for the Contributor to get familiar with the Organization's workflow and contributing guidelines. It also encourages the Contributor to communicate with their Mentor regarding the timeline of weekly tasks. I have contributed to Metasploit previously, so I have a good idea about the codebase and workflow. My previous contributions have equally ranged among creating issues, creating PRs, and reviewing PRs of fellow contributors.  
  
## Work Done in the Community Bonding Period  
* **Successfully setup the Development Environment.** Forked the Metasploit Project Repository and set up a local development environment for working on the codebase locally and then later creating Pull Requests for merging my developed code.  
* **Fixed Meeting times with my Mentor (Twice a Week).** Communicated with my Mentor and we decided to workout with two meetings every week: One on Monday (the start of the week) to plan the work for the current week and the other on Friday (the closing of the week) to evaluate the work done and for feedback.  
* **Fixed work strategies and evaluation guidelines with my Mentor.** Worked out with my Mentor and we decided to use the **Trello** app for tracking my work throughout the project. We would be dividing the whole project in weekly tasks which would be put up in Trello. Trello is a project management app which allows to track small tasks easily by pinning them in separate columns like **Backlogs**, **To-Do**, **Done** etc.  
* **Worked on merging the exisitng PRs.** I am also working on merging my [Open PR](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/16094) which is about fixing the Metasploit database initialization issue in systems which use the **pg_ctl** helper for initialization (e.g. Arch Linux).  
* **Setup this blog**. Yup, setting up this blog was a part of the Community Bonding work as well. Thanks to my Mentor for suggesting me the [Beautiful-Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) theme which was easy and quick to setup! This is a weekly wrapper blog which summarizes all the work done during each week for my GSoC Project.  
* **Talked with mentor about improvements.** We spent a great amount of time here in investigating the related codebase of my project. This led us in realizing some improvements which we can work upon as a part of my GSoC project. These improvements are listed in the below section.
