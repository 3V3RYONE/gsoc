The Coding Period is finally here! This article summarizes the work done during the first week of the Coding Period of Google Summer of Code. The primary work during the first week was to analyze the related library code and figure out where exactly new code needs to be implemented! Let's look through the details!  
  
As mentioned in my last blog post, [read it here](https://3v3ryone.github.io/gsoc/2022-06-08-community-bonding-period/), we worked out some changes in the plan of project during the community bonding period. Thus, it was worth our time to spend the first week in analyzing the existing library code, so that we know the method calls and where exactly the HTTP-Trace wrapper class needs to be present, what parameters are needed to be passed to the method in wrapper class etc. Let's continue and look at the work done in details. Here is the link to my project in the GSoC site : [Project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/I4PxrljP)  
  
## Task 1 : Analyzing Library Code  
  
## Task 2 : Understanding Flow of Control of Methods  
  
## Task 3 : Objects and Parameters  
  
## Conclusion  
  
This marks the end of the Community Bonding Period of GSoC'22 :)! The Community Bonding period was really exciting and informative, where I got to know about the real-life workflow in an Organization and how to plan the timeline of the project effectively. This included Project Management, Official meetings and of course, clear communication with my Mentor. I really appreciate the essence of this period specifically dedicated to the contributors in getting acquainted to the Organization and learning about their workflow!  
  
Catch you up in the coding period! :)
